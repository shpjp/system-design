# System Design – Low Level Design (LLD)

📌 This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and practice problems while studying **System Design** with a focus on **Low Level Design (LLD)**.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals in designing scalable, modular, and maintainable systems.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- **C++ / Java** → for implementing LLD  
- **UML Tools** → for diagrams (Lucidchart, PlantUML, or draw.io)  
- **GitHub Markdown** → for structured documentation

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen **design thinking** before coding.  
- Learn how to translate **requirements → classes & interactions**.  
- Build a collection of reusable **design patterns and boilerplates**.  
- Prepare for **System Design Interviews (LLD round)**.
